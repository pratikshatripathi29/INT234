    "✅ What is Feature Scaling?\n",
    "Feature scaling is the process of transforming all numerical features to a similar scale.\n",
    "Feature scaling is one of the MOST important preprocessing steps in machine learning — especially for algorithms that use distance, gradients, or magnitude of features.\n",
    "Without scaling:\n",
    "Features with large values dominate\n",
    "Model becomes biased\n",
    "Accuracy decreases\n",
    "1️⃣ Standardization (StandardScaler) = mean = 0, standard deviation = 1,values around -3 to +3\n",
    "2️⃣ Normalization (MinMaxScaler) = Scales values to 0–1 range."

    "🎯 Why Encoding?\n",
    "Machine learning models cannot understand text. So we convert categorical data → numerical data\n",
